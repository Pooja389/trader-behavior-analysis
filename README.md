# Trader Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes **trader behavior** based on market sentiment (Fear, Greed, Neutral).  
It focuses on how traders change their trading patterns in terms of:

- Trade frequency by sentiment
- Average trade size (as a leverage proxy)
- Long/Short bias
- PnL and win rate comparison
- Trader segmentation (high vs low leverage, frequent vs infrequent, consistent vs inconsistent winners)

A simple predictive model is also included to explore next-day trader profitability, along with clustering of traders into behavioral types.

## Features
- Visualizations for trade frequency, leverage proxy, and long/short bias  
- Segmentation of traders into meaningful groups  
- Simple Random Forest model to predict profitable trades  
- Behavioral clustering using KMeans  
- Easy-to-run Python scripts for analysis
